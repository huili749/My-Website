In China, the development of subways often lags behind that of urban areas. During the initial phases of subway construction, the emphasis on expanding the line network sometimes led to neglecting the comprehensive development of station areas, resulting in a lack of coordination between station area development and the overall city.

This initiative, centered around Feixi Road Station in Hefei City, introduces a multi-dimensional slow-traffic system focusing on low-carbon transportation, resource integration, and spatial experience. The goal is to broaden the impact of the Metro Living Zone, facilitating comprehensive integration of transportation, cultural heritage, and life experiences.
