The site is located at Baishuiqiao Station in the suburban area of Nanjing, surrounded by a large number of residential areas. Since people live a slow-paced lifestyle here, the traditional TOD model in the city center is not suitable. The blunt connection between the urban core and the suburbs leads to low utilization efficiency of urban space, and the low comfort of citizens' space experience, so it cannot drive regional vitality.

In this project, in order to adapt to the current situation of diverse natural ecology and social ecology, I established a TOD model in suburban with a new catalyst and tension, which integrates everyday life. In contrast to strict division of land use functions, I want to realize the transition between the station and the city with a network weaving, and broadly define leisure and entertainment spaces such as open-air lawns and in between spaces instead of just open squares. This means that more gathering patterns of people's everyday life have been integrated into the site, and the original boundary attributes have been further weakened in weaving. Finally, between the core area and the residential area, between high-intensity and low-density, points are threaded and lines are formed into a network, allowing the station and the city to grow together.
